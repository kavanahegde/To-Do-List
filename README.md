          To-Do List Application
This project is a simple and elegant To-Do List application built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to add, delete, and toggle the completion status of tasks. The state of the tasks is persisted in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the to-do list remains even after refreshing the page.

* Add Tasks: Input a new task using the input box and add it to the list with the "ADD +" button.
* Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete icon.
* Toggle Task Completion: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete by clicking on the task.
       Technologies Used
* React.js: For building the user interface and managing state.
* Tailwind CSS: For styling the components with utility-first CSS classes.
* Local Storage: To persist the state of the to-do list across page reloads.
